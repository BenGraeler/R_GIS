# R_GIS
> ## [Bridging R with ArcGIS](https://r-arcgis.github.io/) - _Examples_

Requirements
------------
 - [ArcGIS R bridge](https://github.com/R-ArcGIS/r-bridge-install)
 - [R Statistical Computing Software](http://www.r-project.org)

### Using R as a scripting tool to generate geostatistical tools for ArcGIS to work with.

- This Repository has two tools as of now meant for kriging 
     * One is for Ordinary kriging while the other is Universal kriging tool.
- The Ordinary kriging tool simply interpolates the values.
- The Universal kriging tool uses a covariate [sqrt(dist)] to interpolate the values.

## Credits

Ordinary and Universal kriging use the [gstat package](http://www.gstat.org/gstat.pdf) for R:
