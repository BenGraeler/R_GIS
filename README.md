# R_GIS
##Bridging R with ArcGIS.

###Using R as a scripting tool to generate geostatistical tools for ArcGIS to work with.

-This Repository has two tools as of now meant for kriging - One is for Ordinary kriging while the other is Universal kriging tool.

-The Ordinary kriging tool simply interpolates the values.
-The Universal kriging tool uses a covariate [sqrt(dist)] to interpolate the values.


## **Using R with ArcGIS to predicted the attributes of the unsampled locations using kriging with the ‘gstat’ package**
