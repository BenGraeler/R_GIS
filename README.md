# R_GIS
Bridging R with ArcGIS.

Using R as a scripting tool to generate geostatistical tools for ArcGIS to work with.

This Repository has two tols as of now.
One is for Ordinary kriging while the other is Universal kriging tool.

The Ordinary kriging tool simply interpolates the values.
The Universal kriging tool uses a covariate [sqrt(dist)] to interpolate the values.
